1	Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2	/game/playstation/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2	98	7.4	"The soundtrack of my youth. Just the music makes this game a must-own, but the silky-smooth controls, along with the map design, make this one of the finest PS1 and early PC game titles ever released. Thanks to the community, the PC release has now been patched with high-res stereo sound, and support for Windows 10 and new high-res widescreen resolutions... it STILL ROCKS!"

3	SoulCalibur	/game/dreamcast/soulcalibur	98	8.5	 The best fighting game I've ever played by far! It's got everything; eye-candy graphics, great characters & some of the most amazing moves I've seen in a long time. It even seems to have a plot (of sorts) which I really like; the characters have real depth & even a personal history. The thing I like about it most of all are all the hidden extras you uncover when you complete the game. It gives you a real added incentive to carry on playing. I would personally recommend this game to anyone.	Namco	Sep  8, 1999	Namco	['Action', 'Fighting', '3D']	T	1-2 	Dreamcast
